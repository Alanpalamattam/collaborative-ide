## **Overview**
This project introduces a **Collaborative Online IDE** designed to simplify the development of **React Native applications** through **AI-powered code assistance** and **QR code-based app testing**. Developers can collaborate in real-time, benefiting from an environment optimized for coding, debugging, and testing mobile apps.

The platform defines two primary roles:  
- **Leader/Admin:** Manages the project and assigns roles to team members.  
- **Developer:** Collaborates on the code with assigned permissions.  

This system ensures mobile app development is efficient and dynamic with real-time feedback, AI suggestions, and seamless testing capabilities.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Collaboration:**  
  Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously with live updates.

- **AI Code Assistance:**  
  Offers intelligent suggestions, error detection, and code improvements.

- **QR Code-Based Testing:**  
  Generate QR codes to quickly deploy and test applications on mobile devices.

- **Role-Based Access Control:**  
  Admin assigns roles (Editor or Viewer) to developers for controlled project management.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  A modern, responsive interface for an optimal development experience.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Socket.io  
- **AI Assistance:** Integration with AI libraries  
- **Mobile App Testing:** QR code generation and scanning  
- **Database:** MongoDB (for project details and role assignments)
